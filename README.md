Introducing a FUN new game: Lay It On Li!

Inspired by a friend who keeps fall asleep, I decided to create an interface to track points and control the flow of the game.

All you need is identifiable sticky notes (one for each player) and a sleepy friend.

Enjoy x


# the game
Enter the players' names
The game will choose a play order
Each player will be told which body part to aim for
  The player may re-spin however they get a 5 point penalty
The player makes the move and records the result in the system
Waking up the sleeper is an instant elimination from the game
If there are enough players, elimination of players increases the difficulty of the targets

In later versions it may be possible for players to apply their own scoring system
