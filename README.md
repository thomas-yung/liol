Introducing a FUN new game: Lay It On Li!<br />
<br />
Inspired by a friend who keeps fall asleep, I decided to create an interface to track points and control the flow of the game.<br />
<br />
All you need is identifiable sticky notes (one for each player) and a sleepy friend.<br />
<br />
Enjoy x<br />

<br />
# the game
Enter the players' names<br />
The game will choose a play order<br />
Each player will be told which body part to aim for<br />
  The player may re-spin however they get a 5 point penalty<br />
The player makes the move and records the result in the system<br />
Waking up the sleeper is an instant elimination from the game<br />
If there are enough players, elimination of players increases the difficulty of the targets<br />
<br />
In later versions it may be possible for players to apply their own scoring system<br />
<br />
